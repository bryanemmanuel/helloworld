                Hellow, my name is <b>Naruto Uzumaki</b>, but you can call me <b>Uzu</b> for short. <br>
                I’m from Hidden Leaf Village and I’m 18 years old. My birthday is <u>October 10, 2006</u>, 
                and I am a Computer Science student <br> at <i>Konoha Ninja Academy</i>.

        <div>


            <p>My mother's name is <del>Kushina</del>, and my father's name is <del>Minato</del>. 
                I have one sister, and her name is <mark>Himawari</mark>.<br> 
                My hobbies include playing with fire, and I enjoy eating ramen. 
                Most of the time, I spend practicing new jutsu and sleeping.<br> 
                My dream is to become the Hokage.
